                <p>RecessHacks strives to create a hackathon environment where every participant and volunteer feels welcome, included, respected, and secure. To uphold this commitment, all attendees, spanning sponsors, students, speakers, judges, volunteers, and organizers, are expected to adhere to the following code of conduct at all times.</p>
                <br />

                <p>Harassment encompasses various behaviors, including but not limited to offensive written posts, comments, or messages related to gender, age, sexual orientation, ability, physical appearance, race, or religion. It also includes the display of sexual or graphic images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassment, photography, or video recording without consent, sustained disruption of talks or events, inappropriate contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.</p>
                <br />

                <p>Participants engaging in any of these harmful behaviors will be promptly requested to cease their actions. Sponsors, speakers, volunteers, and organizers are all expected to adhere to the anti-harassment policy. Specifically, sponsors should refrain from using sexualized images, activities, or other graphic materials, and booth staff, including volunteers, should avoid wearing sexualized clothing, uniforms, costumes, or creating a sexualized environment.</p>
                <br />

                <p>Furthermore, hacks or projects submitted by teams that violate this code may face disqualification or be denied the right to demo at the discretion of the event organizers.</p>
                <br />

                <p>While photography is encouraged, participants should be given a reasonable chance to opt out. If someone objects to being photographed, their request should be respected. Taking photographs in contexts where individuals have a reasonable expectation of privacy, such as capturing screenshots or pictures of their screens without consent, is considered inappropriate.</p>
                <br />

                <p>In the event of harmful behavior, the event organizers may take appropriate action, including issuing warnings or expelling the perpetrator from the event.</p>
                <br />
                
                <p>If you experience harassment, witness someone else being harassed, or have any concerns, please follow the reporting procedures provided at the end of this document and report the incident immediately. Hackathon staff, including the Co-Directors, will be easily identifiable, and they can be reached at all times through the provided phone numbers. We highly value your attendance and expect all participants to adhere to these rules at hackathon and workshop venues, as well as during all related social events.</p>
                <br />
